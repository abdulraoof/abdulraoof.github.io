<h3>Exotel Campaigns</h3>
<p class="lead">How might we enable the customers to drive growth and engagement using calls and SMS?</p>
<section>
    <h4>The Context</h4>
    <p>
    Exotel is a cloud telephony platform. It powers voice and SMS communication of businesses. The customer base of Exotel covers both small businesses and large enterprises.
	Exotel supports call and SMS campaigns, and it generates significant revenue. 
    </p> 
</section>
<section>
	<h4>My Role</h4>
	<p>I was responsible for research and design. I worked along with product managers and engineers. Also, involved sales, customer success and customer support teams throughout the process.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>The Problem</h4>
	<p>
	A campaign service on top of cloud based telecom infrastructure has a lot advantages over the traditional call or SMS campaigns. But we haven't explored those possibilities to provide better campaign experience. The campaign offering was primitive, and we received a lot of customer feedbacks related to it.
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>Who User What?</h4>
	<p>Campaigns were majorly used for promotional purposes, to drive growth or to engage customers. That means the users vary from growth hacker in the marketing team to customer engagement or operation manager. Also, there are transactional use cases for campaigns. For example, pick up scheduling in e-commerce. </p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>Investigating the issue</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>One to one interviews with customers</li>
			<li>Analysis of support tickets related to campaigns</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		We had a lot of insights related to campaigns which we captured during our regular customer interviews. We structured those finding and shared it with sprint team before the sprint.

<section>
	<h4>The Design Sprint</h4>
	<p>To address the significant issues, we decided to conduct a Design Sprint (format proposed by Google Ventures). </p> 
</section>
<section>
	<h4>Sprint Team</h4>
	<p>The team was one product manager and two designers. We included people from sales, marketing, customer success and engineering in different sessions during the sprint.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>Long Tearm Goal and Sprint Questions</h4>
	<p>
		After series of discussions, we agreed on the following long term goal.
	</p>
	<p>"Empower our customers to drive growth and engagement using calls and SMS".</p>
	<p>We also decided to answer the following questions through the sprint. 
		<ul>
			<li>How do we ensure customers default to Exotel campaigns to drive growth and engagement?</li>
			<li>How to make the campaigns more flexible and extensible?</li>
			<li>How do we ensure timeliness and delivery?</li>
			<li>How can we help customers to analyse the results of the campaigns?</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<section>
	<h4>Expert Interviews</h4>
	<p>We had identified and scheduled expert interviews before hand. The participants include people from Sales, Marketing, Customer Success and Engineering. We investigated their vision, feedback and concerns related to the campaigns. We also asked their opinions on long term goal and sprint questions. Based on that we made minor modifications for the sprint questions. </p>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>Deriving Themes</h4>
	<p>By combining data from customer interviews and stakeholder interviews, we came up with How Might We questions. Each person in the sprint team did it individually. After that together we grouped the how might we notes to derive themes and patterns. </p>

<section>
	<h4>Breaking Things Down</h4>
	<p>By understanding the customer concerns, and other feedbacks, we identified three parts of the overall experience. 
		<ul>
			<li>Scheduling</li>
			<li>Delivery</li>
			<li>Analysis</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<section>
		<h5>Scheduling</h5>	
		<p>This where the user creates and schedule a campaign. Scheduling a campaign has multiple steps, and some steps use other product features. This understanding leads to the following discovery.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		"The campaign experience depends on the experience of its depended features". It means we have to address issues those dependent features. 
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Delivery</h5>
		<p>Once user schedules the campaign, it should reach to the recipients in the specified time. Delivery rate, delivery time, etc. plays a significant role here. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Analysis</h5>
		<p>Measurement of the success or impact of the campaigns is critical for the customer. The current offering was not up to the mark when it comes to the analysis and the reporting</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Inspirations and Lightning Demos</h4>
	<p>After defining the problems, we decided to study how others are solving similar problems. Each person worked individually and came with presentations demonstrating analogous inspirations. Interesting ideas are captured so that the team can use it later in the sprint. </p>

	<h4>Conceptualising Solutions</h4>
	<p>At this stage, the walls in the sprint room were full of questions, notes, and ideas. Since the sprint team was small, everyone needed to work on all three major stages of the campaign experience. 
	Everyone worked on creating solutions for each stage (scheduling, delivery and analysis). The team made use of four step sketching process. 
	Each one presented their ideas, and the team shortlisted best ideas.

<section>
	<h4>Storyboarding</h4>
	<p>We decided to convert the entire flow into a storyboard so that everyone gets the overall picture. It also helped us to communicate the whole experience with people outside of the sprint team. </p>

</section>
<section>
	<h4>Prototyping</h4>
	<p>The next stage was prototyping the solution. We assigned tasks for sprint team, and each person worked on different part of the prototype. One person was responsible for combining everything into one. Because of the time limitation, we had to skip a lot of details. At the same time, we made sure that, the prototype includes the core ideas. </p>
