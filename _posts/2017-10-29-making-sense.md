# Making Sense

Recently I have been following Indian newspapers and news channels on different issues. It's interesting to see how these institutions are using data to establish their point of view. Of course, it is excellent to witness rational debate based on facts, but we have to be aware of about what happens exactly. Most of this concerns are quite old, but it worths reminding ourselves once in a while. These problems are hard to solve, it requires considerable amount expertise and time to address them. But I would like to reiterate on few things that I think would be helpful for anyone. 

## Incomplete information:
It's an obvious trap, but we often tend to forget about it. People and organisations can selectively pick the data that supports their point of view and discard the opposite. As an audience, we should be sceptic about what is there and should be prepared to ask right questions that reveal the big picture. For example, if the data is related to a specific period, you could ask what happened before and after. If the data is about a place, you can have a look at the nearby data. 

## The numbers and the reality:
>"Numbers on the screen are representations of the real world.
Look at the real world, not just representations. Walk around what you want to learn about."

Numbers are abstractions of the real world. But if there is a mismatch between the representations and the real world, that is a red sign. 

## Cause-effect relationship:
Think of government policies, organisational initiatives etc. it becomes tough to establish the relationship between the cause and effect under these situations. One strategy to approach the problem would be to think about alternate possibilities. Make yourself comfortable that different actions can contribute to the same outcome. 

>"Everything we see, read and hear is produced for a purpose." 

And keep the above sentence close to your heart, be critical about what do you see, read and hear.
