The way mind work has always been a mystery. I am always confused when it comes to creative problem solving. How people are coming up with solutions for problems or ideas for improvement? What make designers different from others when it comes to problem solving?

Designers largely depend on constraints to solve problems they are dealing with. For designer concious pick up of constrains are very important. Constraints are not just constraints, but they direct designer to the intended solution.

The above diagram is based on ideas from Moggridge, 2006. Conscious pickup of constraints results in the unconscious synthesis of solutions.
