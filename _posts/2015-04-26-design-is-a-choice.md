<p class="post_text">
Defining design is always a difficult thing. Anyway, the overall understanding of the  discipline will be more useful than definitions.
It will take considerable mental effort and practice to get that understanding. Recently I came across <a href="https://vimeo.com/5189134">a talk by Bill Buxton</a>, where he describes design as choice. As a design practitioner, I felt it very convincing. 
Design process consists generating plenty of alternative solutions for the given problem and choosing best among them. 
Buxton conveys that Designer need to be creative in both  generation and selection of solutions.

In case of an individual practitioner, it is somewhat straight forward. But most of the designers are working in teams (in opinion they should be, I will be discussing it in a later post). In order to come up with a good solution, the team should be able to identify it among the alternatives. The overall result depends on not only generative skills, but also critiquing skills of the team more than individuals.Alan Kay said it beautifully.

Update: Bill Buxton discusses the ideas of the talk in depth in his book Sketching User Experieces. It is an awesome read for anyone involved in UX and product design in general.
